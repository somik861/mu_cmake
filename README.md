## Attention: 
Please download whole repository using git clone --recursive `link`

## Credits: 
The **mu** project is not my work, neither am I a co-worker of authors. The only thing I have created is CmakeLists.txt file that can compile the project. 

## Note: 
I strongly recommend using **gib** tool to build the project, 
as it is maintained by true authors (simply run `make` inside *mu* directory). 
CmakeLists.txt was created only to support enviromnents, 
for which **gib** is not prepared (e.g. cygwin).
